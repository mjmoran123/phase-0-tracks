 # pseudocode for spy name algorithm

 # Split the name string into an array of a first and last name
 # Create a new array for the spy name that takes in the 1th element of the original array as the 0th and 0th as 1th
 # Iterate through each name string and change letters accordingly
 # 	downcase strings
 # 	if on "aeiou" change mod 5
 # 	if on "bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz" and change mod 21
 # Join the array of spy names into a new string
