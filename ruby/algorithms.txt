-Enter elevator
-Ask master for floor
-Push button associated with floor master selected (press it two or three times, it definitely makes the elevator faster)
-Wait until floor indicator shows the floor you selected.
-Hold door open for master and exit behind him.

Common Task Algorithm (I was doing some yardwork this weekend)
