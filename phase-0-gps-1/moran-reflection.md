#GPS 1.1 Reflection
1. What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

   I wasn't struggling with anything in particular, but I didn't think I had a great understanding of all of the big ideas.

2. What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

   I gained some experience working with the bid ideas of git and git hub, but I almost feel like I am more confused now than when I started.  This isn't because the challenge was confusing, but mostly because I got to see things in action that I don't completely understand.

3. What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

   We asked some questions about being in the correct directory for your repository, some questions about making changes to a file on the wrong branch, and some general questions about GPS.

4. What still confuses you about Git?

   I still have some confusion about the entire process.  I am not worried that I won't be able to clear it up with experience, but there are lots of small details that are a bit nebulous.  I understand the general cycle of modifying files, staging and commiting, and also branching.  I guess I am a bit confused about merging branches.

5. How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

   My partner and my guide made this a good experience for me.  I thought communication was great, and I enjoyed the experience.
