What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I was struggling with the syntax of pulling and pushing up to github.  our leader definitely helped put it in to terms i understood

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
way more understanding why things were the way they were so that helped reason out when i was stuck. 

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
the fetch and merge were new to me so i had to ask why we were doing those and not just pulls. 

What still confuses you about Git?
some times my master gets so many commits ahead and i can't figure out why those are there

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
so i was a bit nervous but once i found we were on the same page and the same skill set it was very comfortable and the leader was great
