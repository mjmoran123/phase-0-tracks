# Web Servers
1. Linux assumes you know what you are doing and lets you do pretty much anything you want, even if it will break something. Linux is open-source and is designed for developers.
2. My understanding at this point of a VPS is a machine that is carved out on another machine that can be remotely accessed and behaves pretty much exactly like any other machine. 

    Upon doing some research, I have found that a VPS is *private* so you are not sharing the server with other sites. This means their traffic or instability won't impact the performance of your site.

    Also, on a VPS, you have access to the root, so you can really do anything that you want. You don't have to depend on or wait for a hosting provider.

    Scalability is much easier on a virtual machine, in either direction.

3. Running as root gives every application access and privileges to your entire system, which means any bugs or viruses could wipe things out on your system. Running applications on a user level provides safety and security to your system.
